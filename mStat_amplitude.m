%      This function takes the x,y coordinates of the peaks and troughs 
%      of a given river reach and calculates the planimetric amplitude 
%      of each bend.  Note:  the planimetric amplitude is defined as the
%      distance between the point of maximum curvature and the line between
%      the limiting inflection points of each bend.  In this function, the
%      amplitude is found using the vector distance formula and the
%      "createLine" and "projPointOnLine" functions from the MATLAB file
%      exchange.
%      
%      INPUTS:
%      
%      inflectionX = the X-coordinates of each inflection point defined
%      along the river reach.  
%      inflectionY = the Y-coordinates of each inflection point defined
%      along the river reach. 
%      nBends = the number of bends in the river reach of interest.   
%      maxCurvX = the x-coordinates of the peaks and troughs along the
%      river reach.  
%      maxCurvY = the y-coordinates of the peaks and troughs along the
%      river reach.
%      numMaxPts = an array, where each row represents a bend, and the
%      number in that row tells how many points of maximum curvature are in
%      that bend.
%
%      OUTPUTS:
%      amplitudeOfBends = a structure that contains the planarmetric 
%      amplitude of each river bend in order from upstream to downstream.  

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%      The x,y coordinates of the peaks/troughs of each bend are known
%      already as maxCurvX and maxCurvY.  Make a matrix to
%      contain all of these maximum curvature points.  

maxCurvXY = [maxCurvX maxCurvY];
sizeMaxCurvXY = size(maxCurvXY);

%      Thus, the first step in the calculation is to estimate a point along
%      the line between the limiting inflection points that can serve as 
%      the other end of the amplitude distance.  This point is found below
%      by projecting the point of maximum curvature onto the constructed 
%      line between the two limiting inflection points. 

%      Construct lines between the two limiting inflection points of each
%      bend.  Store these lines in the matrix called "lineC".  

%lineC = createLine((newInflectionPts(1,:)), newInflectionPts(2,:));
disp("#BENDS");
disp(nBends);
for k = 1:nBends
lineC(k,:) = createLine((newInflectionPts(k,:)), newInflectionPts(k+1,:));
end

%      Now, we can find the amplitude of each bend using the distance
%      formula between the peaks/troughs and the projected points. 
%      If there are more than one points of maximum curvature in a bend,
%      then the amplitude is calculated at each of the points of maximum
%      curvature in that bend, and the largest value is assigned as the
%      amplitude of the bend.
