%% DESCRIPTION: xy2sn.m
%     Given digitized points along the centerline and in-channel data points,
%     creates a spline centerline, calculates the streamwise
%     distance along the centerline, computes the curvature, and
%     returns streamwise and normal (s,n) coordinates for the
%     in-channel data points
%
%% SYNTAX:
%   [snOut,ClSpline,centerlineOut,xyOut,iMiss,iTrans]  =   ...
%        xy2sn(inCenterlinePt,xyDataPt,transParam)
%
%% INPUTS:
%   inCenterlinePt  =   x,y coordinates of points (vertices) digitized
%                       along the channel centerline, used to fit a cubic 
%                       spline for defining a continuous centerline
%   xyDataPt        =   x,y coordinates of in-channel data points, which
%                       will be converted to their corresponding (s,n)
%                       coordinates based on the channel centerline
%   transParam      =   5 X 1 vector of transformation parameters for 
%                       filtering the input coordinates with a 
%                       Savitzky-Golay filter, creating a specified number
%                       of discretization points along the output
%                       centerline, and searching laterally for points to
%                       transform:
%                       [nFilt order window nDiscr rMax]
%                           nFilt:  number of times smoothing filter will
%                                   be applied to the coordinates
%                           order:  order of the polynomial used to perform
%                                   the filtering
%                           window: number of points included in the filter
%                                   window
%                           nDiscr: number of points used to discretize the 
%                                   centerline in the resampled spline; 
%                                   determines the distance interval between 
%                                   spline segment end points, which is also 
%                                   the interval at which the curvature values
%                                   are calculated
%                           rMax:   maximum distance from channel centerline 
%                                   that will be used to obtain n coordinates; 
%                                   should be set slightly larger than the 
%                                   greatest plausible channel width

%% OUTPUTS:
%   snOut           =   2-column matrix of coordinates [s n], where ...
%                   s:  streamwise coordinate (distance downstream,
%                       increasing in the downstream direction);
%                   n:  normal (transverse) coordiante; perpendicular
%                       distance from data point to channel centerline,
%                       positive if left of centerline, negative if right;
%                       NOTE: untransformed points given NaN coordinates
%   ClSpline        =   structure array containing the coefficients for the
%                       calculated spline segments along the centerline; see
%                       ppval, unmkpp, and spline in the MATLAB help
%   centerlineOut   =   nPoint X 4 matrix containing information on the 
%                       spline-generated continuous channel centerline:

%                           xCoordOut:  x coordinates of vertices along

%                           yCoordOut:  y coordinates of vertices along
%                                       the output centerline
%                           cumDist:    cumulative length along the channel 
%                                       centerline from the origin at the 
%                                       upstream end of the reach
%                           curveOut:   curvature values calculated at each
%                                       vertex of the spline centerline
%   xyOut           =   original x,y coordinates corresponding to the computed
%                       s,n; untransformed points given NaN coordinates
%   iMiss           =   vector of indices of xy data points that were NOT
%                       transformed and have been assigned NaN coordinates
%                       in s,n, and xyOut; these points were either outside

%
%% NOTES:
%  *  Calls curvature.m and its helper integrand.m
%  *  Follows the sign convention of Smith and McLean (1984), which ensures a
%     right-handed coordinate system with s oriented downstream, n positive to
%     the left of the centerline, and z positive vertically upward; note that
%     the curvature convention adopted here is also that of Smith and McLean
%     (1984), which is opposite that of Fagherazzi et al. (2004) and Merwade
%     (2004)
%  *  The initial channel centerline can be digitized from an image using 
%     getline; data points can be created using ginput;
%  *  The assignment of an algebraic sign to the n-coordinate is based on the
%     unit normal vector, which is assumed to point to the left of the
%     centerline - that is, in the direction of positive n, which will be
%     the case if the centerline is digitized from upstream to downstream
%  *  The input centerline coordinates are filtered using a Savitzky-Golay 
%     filter suggested by Fagherazzi et al. (2004); see curvature.m
%  *  Note that some points might be missed and not transformed; these
%     missing points are assigned NaN coordinates in s,n, and xyOut
%     and the vectors of indices iMiss and iTrans can be used to identify
%     and select which points have not and have been transformed,
%     respectively, for plotting and further analysis

% Loop over the l segments of the centerline and compute the derivatives; note
% that the coefficients in the matrix c alternate between the x and y

% on the even-numbered rows

%% Assign s,n coordinates using polygons defined by the normal vectors
% The basic algorithm here consists of three steps:
% 1)  For each pair of successive nodes along the centerline, define a polygon
%     with vertices along the centerline between these nodes and at two points 
%     a distance rMax from the centerline in a direction defined by the unit 
%     normal vector
% 2)  Find all in-channel data points within this polygon
% 3)  Discretize the centerline segment and compute the distances from each of
%     the interpolated centerline nodes to each of the in-channel points within
%     the polygon
% 4)  The minimum centerline-data point distance defines the n coordinate, and
%     the index of the centerline node at which this minimum occurs is used to
%     refine the s coordinate; note that n will be positive for points within
%     polygons on the left side of the channel
% 5)  Repeat the previous four steps a second time, but now orient the polygons
%     in the directon opposite the unit normal vector - that is, to the right of
%     the channel; the points in these polygons will have negative n coordinates
%
% This sign convention matches that of Smith and McLean (1984) and ensures a
% right-hand coordinate system with s positive downstream, n positive to the
% left of the centerline, and z positive upward.  Note that the assignment of
% the algebraic sign of n in this algorithm requires that the unit normal vector
% is oriented toward the left of the centerline.  This has been the case in
% every example I have tried so far, but could break down in some cases,
% especially if the centerline nodes are digitized in an upstream direction

% Pre-allocate outputs
xOut    =   zeros(1,length(xCoord));
yOut    =   zeros(1,length(xCoord));
s       =   zeros(1,length(xCoord));
n       =   zeros(1,length(xCoord));

% Begin loop
for iCenter  =  1:length(xCenter)-1;
   % Convert the unit normal vector to polar coordinates so that the angle
   % (orientation) can be preserved and the radius (magnitude) can be easily
   % adjusted to be the user-specified maximum rMax; note that rho will be one,
   % by the definition of the unit normal vector, so it is not output
   theta1   =  cart2pol(xNormal(iCenter),yNormal(iCenter));
   theta2   =  cart2pol(xNormal(iCenter+1),yNormal(iCenter+1));
   
   % Now use these angles and the user-specified rMax to create new Cartesian 
   % coordinates for the vertices of a polygon; note that the vertices defined
   % using the unit normal vectors will need to be offset by the coordinates of
   % the corresponding centerline node (i.e., the origin of the vector must be

   % curved inside (i.e., centerline) of the "polygon"; note that if you
   % just use the original centerline vertices without "filling in" the
